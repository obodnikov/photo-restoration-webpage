I'll investigate the authorization issue with the history button by first reading the relevant documentation and then analyzing the code.

Now let me search for the history endpoint implementation and authentication handling:

Now let me check the API client to see how authentication is handled:

Now let me check how the history component is calling the API:

Let me find the component that has the history button:

Now let me check the HistoryPage to see the actual implementation:

Now let me check the backend logs more carefully and see if there's an issue with the authentication dependency. Let me check the security.py file:

Now I understand the issue! Looking at the logs and code:

1. The `/api/v1/restore/history` endpoint is returning 401 Unauthorized
2. The backend route requires authentication via `user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)` at [restoration.py:300](backend/app/api/v1/routes/restoration.py#L300)
3. The `get_current_user` dependency uses `HTTPBearer()` which expects the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. The frontend's `apiClient.ts` should be adding this header automatically

Let me check the browser network tab to see if the token is being sent. But first, let me verify the auth store is working:

Now I have a complete picture of the issue. Based on the error log and code analysis:

## Problem Analysis

The authorization for the history button doesn't work because of a **401 Unauthorized** error when calling `/api/v1/restore/history`. Here's what's happening:

1. **Backend**: The `/api/v1/restore/history` endpoint at [restoration.py:289-365](backend/app/api/v1/routes/restoration.py#L289-L365) requires authentication via `Depends(get_current_user)`
2. **Frontend**: The `historyService.ts` uses the `get()` function from `apiClient.ts` which should automatically inject the JWT token
3. **Token validation**: The `apiClient.ts` checks if the token exists and is not expired before making the request

## Proposed Solution

The issue is likely that:
1. The token might be expired when navigating to history
2. The token might not be properly stored/retrieved from the auth store
3. There might be a timing issue where the token check happens before the auth state is initialized

I propose the following fixes:

### Fix 1: Add token debugging to identify the root cause
Add console logging to see what's happening with the token

### Fix 2: Ensure auth store is initialized before making API calls
Make sure `initializeAuthStore()` is called in the app initialization

### Fix 3: Add better error handling in the history page
Show a clearer message if authentication fails

Would you like me to implement these fixes?

👤 **USER:**
> yes implement

Let me start by checking the App.tsx to see if the auth store is being initialized:

Good! The auth store is being initialized. Now let me add debugging to the apiClient to see what's happening with the token:

Now let me also add debugging to the uploadFile function:

Now let me add better error handling to the HistoryPage:

Now let me add better error handling to show authentication errors more clearly:

Now let me add debugging to the useHistory hook to see what's happening:

Now let's rebuild the frontend to apply these changes:

Good! Now let's restart the docker containers to apply the changes:

Understood! Let me update the todo and provide you with instructions for testing:

Perfect! I've implemented the debugging and error handling improvements. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added comprehensive debugging to [apiClient.ts](frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts)**
   - Added console logs to track authentication state before each API request
   - Logs include: token presence, authentication status, expiration time, and endpoint
   - Both `request()` and `uploadFile()` functions now have detailed logging

### 2. **Enhanced error handling in [useHistory.ts](frontend/src/features/history/hooks/useHistory.ts)**
   - Added detailed error logging with status codes and error messages
   - Implemented specific error messages for 401 (authentication) errors
   - Added logging for successful history loads

### 3. **Improved HistoryPage user experience in [HistoryPage.tsx](frontend/src/features/history/pages/HistoryPage.tsx)**
   - Added component mount logging
   - Added retry functionality on error message close
   - Better error feedback to users

### 4. **Verified auth initialization in [App.tsx](frontend/src/app/App.tsx)**
   - Confirmed that `initializeAuthStore()` is called on app start
   - Confirmed that `setupTokenExpiryCheck()` is running

## Testing Instructions

After you rebuild your containers, please:

1. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Log in** to the application
3. **Click the "History" button** in the navigation
4. **Check the console output** for these debug messages:
   - `[API Client] Auth check:` - Shows token state before the request
   - `[useHistory] Loading history:` - Shows pagination parameters
   - Any error messages with `[API Client]` or `[useHistory]` prefixes

## What to Look For

The console logs will tell us:
- ✅ **If the token exists** when calling the history endpoint
- ✅ **If the token is expired** when making the request
- ✅ **The exact error** that's causing the 401 response

Once you've rebuilt the containers and tested, please share the console output so I can identify the root cause!

👤 **USER:**
> hmm. right after pushing history button console field cleaned up and login screen appeared

Ah! That's very revealing! The console is being cleared and you're immediately redirected to the login page. This tells me exactly what's happening:

The issue is in the **apiClient.ts** - when it checks for the token, it's finding either:
1. **No token**, OR
2. **An expired token**

And then it's redirecting you to login **before** the console logs can be seen.

Let me add debugging **earlier** in the process, before the redirect happens:

Now let me also add a localStorage check to see what's actually stored:

Now rebuild the frontend:

Perfect! I've added debugging that will survive the redirect. Now when you rebuild your containers and test:

## What You'll See

1. **Click the History button**
2. You'll get an **alert popup** that says either:
   - "DEBUG: No token found. Check sessionStorage for last_auth_check"
   - OR "DEBUG: Token expired. Check sessionStorage for last_auth_check"

3. **After the redirect to login**, open the browser console and type:
   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('last_auth_check'))
   ```

This will show you the exact state of the auth when the redirect happened, including:
- Whether a token existed
- If it was expired
- The exact timestamp comparisons

Also, you can check in the console (before clicking History) what's in localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('auth-storage')
```

This will tell us if the auth state is being persisted correctly by Zustand.

**Please rebuild your containers and let me know:**
1. What the alert says
2. What `sessionStorage.getItem('last_auth_check')` shows
3. What `localStorage.getItem('auth-storage')` shows (before clicking History)

index-BFlO9beh.js:83 [API Client] Added Authorization header for endpoint: /models
After pushing history console field cleaned up

Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. Look at the `expiresAt` timestamp:

- **expiresAt**: 1765962079831 (December **17**, 2025)
- **now**: 1765875679837 (December **16**, 2025)

The token is **valid** when loading models, but then the console clears when you click History. This suggests the Zustand persist middleware might not be properly configured.

Let me check the authStore configuration more carefully:

I see the problem! There's **duplicate storage** happening:

1. **Zustand persist middleware** stores to `localStorage` with key `'auth-storage'`
2. **setAuth function** also manually stores to `localStorage` with keys `TOKEN_STORAGE_KEY`, `TOKEN_EXPIRY_KEY`, `USER_STORAGE_KEY`
3. **initializeAuthStore** reads from the manual storage keys

This creates a conflict. When the page navigates (like clicking History button), the store might be reinitializing and finding inconsistent data.

The **Zustand persist middleware** should be handling all the storage automatically. Let me fix this:

Now let me simplify the `initializeAuthStore` function since Zustand persist should handle it automatically:

Now let me also remove the old manual localStorage constants since we're using Zustand persist:

Perfect! Now let me rebuild the frontend with these fixes:

Excellent! I've found and fixed the root cause. Here's what was wrong:

## The Problem

Your `authStore.ts` had **duplicate storage mechanisms** that were conflicting:

1. ✅ **Zustand persist middleware** - automatically syncs to `localStorage['auth-storage']`
2. ❌ **Manual localStorage calls** - separately storing to `TOKEN_STORAGE_KEY`, `TOKEN_EXPIRY_KEY`, `USER_STORAGE_KEY`
3. ❌ **initializeAuthStore** - reading from the manual keys instead of relying on Zustand

This caused the auth state to become inconsistent when navigating between pages.

## The Fix

I've updated [authStore.ts](frontend/src/services/authStore.ts) to:
- ✅ **Remove all manual `localStorage` calls** from `setAuth()` and `clearAuth()`
- ✅ **Let Zustand persist middleware handle all storage automatically**
- ✅ **Simplify `initializeAuthStore()`** to just check for expired tokens
- ✅ **Add comprehensive logging** to track the auth state

## Important: Clear Your Browser Storage!

**Before testing**, you need to clear the old conflicting data:

1. Open **DevTools** (F12)
2. Go to **Application** → **Local Storage** → `http://localhost` (or your domain)
3. **Delete these old keys:**
   - `photo_restoration_token`
   - `photo_restoration_token_expiry`
   - `photo_restoration_user`
4. Keep **`auth-storage`** (this is the Zustand persist key)
5. **Refresh the page**

Or simply clear all localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```

Then:
1. **Log in again**
2. **Click the History button**
3. Check the console for `[authStore]` debug messages

The history button should now work! Let me know what happens.

[authStore] Initializing auth store...
index-CtP4N6ko.js:83 [authStore] Current state: {isAuthenticated: false, hasToken: false, expiresAt: null, isExpired: true}expiresAt: nullhasToken: falseisAuthenticated: falseisExpired: true[[Prototype]]: Objectconstructor: ƒ Object()hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty()isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf()propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable()toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString()toString: ƒ toString()valueOf: ƒ valueOf()__defineGetter__: ƒ __defineGetter__()__defineSetter__: ƒ __defineSetter__()__lookupGetter__: ƒ __lookupGetter__()__lookupSetter__: ƒ __lookupSetter__()__proto__: (...)get __proto__: ƒ __proto__()set __proto__: ƒ __proto__()
index-CtP4N6ko.js:83 [authStore] No auth state in localStorage

Perfect! Now I can see the exact problem. After clicking the History button, the auth store is reinitializing and finding **no token** (`hasToken: false`). This means the Zustand persist middleware is **not properly rehydrating** the state from localStorage.

The issue is that when you navigate to `/history`, React is re-mounting the app and calling `initializeAuthStore()` again, but the Zustand persist middleware hasn't finished loading from localStorage yet.

Let me fix this by waiting for the persist middleware to rehydrate before checking the state:

Actually, wait - that's a workaround. The better solution is to use Zustand's `onRehydrateStorage` callback. Let me fix this properly:

Now let me simplify the `initializeAuthStore` since the rehydration callback handles the expiry check:

Now rebuild the frontend:

Perfect! I've fixed the rehydration issue. The problem was that Zustand's persist middleware loads asynchronously, so when we were checking the auth state immediately after navigation, it hadn't finished loading from localStorage yet.

## What I Fixed

Added the `onRehydrateStorage` callback to the Zustand persist configuration in [authStore.ts](frontend/src/services/authStore.ts#L102-L123). This callback:
- ✅ Runs automatically when Zustand loads state from localStorage
- ✅ Logs the rehydration process for debugging
- ✅ Checks if the loaded token is expired
- ✅ Clears auth if the token is expired

## Next Steps

**Please:**

1. **Clear your browser localStorage** (important!):
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Rebuild your containers**

3. **Log in fresh**

4. **Click the History button**

5. **Check the console** for these messages:
   - `[authStore] Starting rehydration from localStorage...`
   - `[authStore] Rehydrated successfully:` (should show `hasToken: true`)

The History page should now work correctly! The token will properly persist across navigation.

Good! The rehydration is working, but it's finding **no token** in localStorage (`hasToken: false`). This means the token is not being **saved** to localStorage in the first place.

Let me check what's in localStorage right after you log in. Can you:

1. **Log in**
2. **Stay on the home page** (don't click History yet)
3. **Open console** and type:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.getItem('auth-storage')
   ```
4. **Share what it shows**

Also, let me check if there's an issue with how the login is saving the auth state. Let me look at the login flow:

The login looks correct - it's calling `setAuth()`. Let me add debugging to see if `setAuth()` is actually being called and if Zustand persist is saving:

Perfect! Now please:

1. **Clear localStorage** again:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Rebuild your containers**

3. **Log in**

4. **Check the console** for these messages:
   - `[authStore] setAuth called:` - Should show the token being saved
   - `[authStore] localStorage after setAuth:` - Should show what's actually in localStorage

This will tell us if Zustand persist is actually saving the data to localStorage or if there's a configuration issue preventing it from persisting.

Excellent! The token **IS** being saved to localStorage! I can see it right there in the `auth-storage` key. The problem is that when you navigate to the History page, the app is **clearing** the auth state somehow.

Let me check if there's something in the routing or navigation that's causing the store to reset. Let me look at the ProtectedRoute component:

Aha! I found the issue! Look at line 25: `if (!isAuthenticated)`. The ProtectedRoute is checking `isAuthenticated` **before** Zustand persist has finished rehydrating from localStorage!

When you navigate to `/history`, React Router renders the ProtectedRoute, which immediately checks `isAuthenticated`. But at that moment, Zustand persist hasn't loaded the state from localStorage yet, so `isAuthenticated` is still `false`, causing an immediate redirect to login.

The solution is to add a rehydration state check. Let me fix this:

Now update the ProtectedRoute to wait for hydration:

Perfect! Now rebuild:

Perfect! **I found the root cause!**

## The Problem

The `ProtectedRoute` component was checking `isAuthenticated` **immediately** when rendering, but Zustand's persist middleware loads from localStorage **asynchronously**. This meant:

1. You click "History" button
2. React Router renders `ProtectedRoute` for `/history`
3. `ProtectedRoute` checks `isAuthenticated` → it's `false` (not loaded from localStorage yet)
4. Immediate redirect to `/login`
5. A few milliseconds later, Zustand finishes loading from localStorage

## The Fix

I added a `hasHydrated` flag to track when Zustand has finished loading from localStorage:

1. **[authStore.ts](frontend/src/services/authStore.ts)**: Added `hasHydrated` state that gets set to `true` when rehydration completes
2. **[ProtectedRoute.tsx](frontend/src/app/ProtectedRoute.tsx)**: Now waits for `hasHydrated` before checking authentication

## Next Steps

**Rebuild your containers** and test:

1. **Log in**
2. **Click History** - it should now work!
3. **Check console** for:
   - `[ProtectedRoute] Waiting for auth store to rehydrate...`
   - `[authStore] Rehydrated successfully:` with `hasToken: true`
   - `[ProtectedRoute] Hydration complete, isAuthenticated: true`

The History page should now load correctly with your restoration history!

The rehydration is working but it's loading **empty state** (`hasToken: false`). This means localStorage has the auth data, but it's **not being loaded** by Zustand persist.

Let me check what's actually in localStorage. Can you run this in the console right now:

```javascript
localStorage.getItem('auth-storage')
```

I suspect the issue is that `hasHydrated` is not being persisted (and shouldn't be), which might be confusing the persist middleware. Let me fix this:

Actually, let me check if the issue is that we're clearing localStorage when logging in fresh. Let me look at what happens after login more carefully. Let me add more debugging:

Perfect! I've added more detailed debugging. Now please:

1. **Rebuild your containers**
2. **Clear localStorage** (just to start fresh):
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```
3. **Log in**
4. **Stay on home page** and check console for:
   ```
   [authStore] localStorage after setAuth:
   ```
   - Share what this shows

5. **Then click History** and check for:
   ```
   [authStore] Raw localStorage value:
   ```
   - Share what this shows

This will tell us if:
- The token is being **saved** correctly after login
- The token is **still there** when clicking History
- The token is being **read** correctly during rehydration

   ❌ Token is **null** - it's been cleared!

Something is **clearing the localStorage** between login and clicking History. This happens so fast it must be during navigation.

The issue is that `clearAuth()` is being called somewhere. Let me add debugging to find where:

Perfect! Now:

1. **Rebuild your containers**
2. **Clear localStorage**: `localStorage.clear()`

   [authStore] clearAuth stack trace:

This will show us **exactly where** `clearAuth()` is being called from and why the auth is being wiped out.

**PERFECT!** I found it! Look at this sequence:

1. ✅ Token is saved correctly after login
2. ✅ History page loads and **has the token**:
   ```
   [API Client] Auth check: {hasToken: true, tokenLength: 193...
   [API Client] Added Authorization header for endpoint: /restore/history...
   ```
3. ❌ **Backend returns 401 Unauthorized** (even though we sent the token!)
4. ❌ Frontend receives 401, clears auth:
   ```
   Received 401, clearing auth and redirecting to login...
   [authStore] clearAuth called!
   ```

The issue is **on the backend**! The frontend is sending the token correctly, but the backend is rejecting it with 401.

Let me check the backend logs. Can you share what the backend container shows when you click History? Run:

```bash
docker logs backend
```

But I suspect the issue is that the `session_id` in the JWT token doesn't match any session in the database. Let me check the login endpoint to see how it creates sessions:

Perfect! I can see that login creates a session at line 88. The issue is that the backend is probably checking if the session exists when validating the history request, but the session might be missing or the database might be getting cleared/reset.

Can you check the **backend logs** to see what error it's showing when it returns 401? Run:

```bash
docker logs backend | tail -50
```

This will show us the exact error from the backend side.

The backend is returning 401 but not logging **why**. The `get_current_user` dependency in [security.py](backend/app/core/security.py#L106-L151) must be failing silently.

Looking back at the code, I see the issue! When `get_current_user` raises an HTTPException with 401, FastAPI just returns it without detailed logging.

Let me add logging to the backend security module to see what's happening:

Perfect! Now please:

1. **Restart the backend container** to pick up the logging changes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart backend
   ```

2. **Log in again** and **click History**

3. **Check the backend logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs backend | tail -20
   ```

This will show us:
- `Validating token: ...` - Confirms the token is being received
- `Token verified - username: ..., session_id: ...` - Shows if verification succeeds
- OR `Token verification failed` - Shows if the token is invalid/expired

This will tell us exactly why the backend is rejecting the token!
