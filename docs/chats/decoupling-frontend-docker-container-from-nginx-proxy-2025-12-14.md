👤 **USER:**
> I would like to change behavour of frontend Docker container. Now it contains hginx in it with hardcoded VITE BASE URL. This is unacceptable for me.
I prefer to have separate indepandent proxy server that already exist and handle many sites on the host.
What I think is that frontend container should run under very simple web server without handling proxy function

I'll help you reconfigure the frontend Docker container to use a simple web server instead of nginx with hardcoded proxy settings. Let me first read the relevant documentation and understand the current setup.

Now I understand the current setup. Let me analyze what you need and propose a solution.

## Current Situation Analysis

Your frontend Docker container currently:
1. Uses nginx as the web server ([frontend/nginx.conf](frontend/nginx.conf:1))
2. Has **hardcoded proxy configuration** for `/api`, `/uploads`, `/processed` endpoints ([frontend/nginx.conf:32-50](frontend/nginx.conf#L32-L50))
3. Has VITE_API_BASE_URL baked into the build at build-time ([frontend/Dockerfile:19-26](frontend/Dockerfile#L19-L26))

## Proposed Solution

I propose **removing the proxy functionality from the frontend container** and using a **simple static file server** instead. This will make the frontend truly independent and allow your external proxy server to handle all routing.

### Changes Required:

1. **Replace nginx with a lightweight static file server** (options):
   - **Option A**: `serve` npm package (Node.js-based, simple)
   - **Option B**: `busybox httpd` (Alpine's built-in, minimal)
   - **Option C**: Keep nginx but remove all proxy directives

2. **Configure frontend to use configurable backend URL**:
   - Build frontend with a runtime-configurable API endpoint
   - Your external proxy will handle routing `/api/*` to the backend

3. **Update Dockerfile** to serve static files only

### Recommended Approach:

**I recommend Option A (`serve` package)** because:
- Very simple and lightweight
- Specifically designed for serving SPAs (handles React Router correctly)
- Easy to configure
- No complex nginx configuration needed

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Modify [frontend/Dockerfile](frontend/Dockerfile)**:
   - Remove nginx stage
   - Add Node.js runtime stage with `serve` package
   - Serve static files from `/app/dist`
   
2. **Remove [frontend/nginx.conf](frontend/nginx.conf)** (no longer needed)

3. **Update [frontend/.env.example](frontend/.env.example)**:
   - Document that `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should be set to your external proxy path
   - Example: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api/v1` (relative, handled by your proxy)

4. **Update [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)** frontend service:
   - Expose port 3000 (or whatever port `serve` uses)
   - Your external proxy will route to `frontend:3000`

5. **Update documentation** to reflect the new architecture

### Your External Proxy Configuration

Your external proxy server would need to:
```nginx
# Route frontend requests
location / {
    proxy_pass http://photo-restoration-frontend:3000;
}

# Route backend API requests
location /api {
    proxy_pass http://photo-restoration-backend:8000;
}

location /uploads {
    proxy_pass http://photo-restoration-backend:8000;
}

location /processed {
    proxy_pass http://photo-restoration-backend:8000;
}
```

## Questions Before Implementation:

1. **Do you want to use the `serve` npm package** or prefer another static file server?
2. **What port should the frontend container expose?** (default: 3000)
3. **Should I remove the nginx service** from docker-compose.yml entirely, or do you want to keep it for reference?
4. **What path will your external proxy use** to route to the frontend? (e.g., `http://frontend:3000` or different host/port?)

Please confirm if this approach matches your needs, and I'll proceed with the implementation.

👤 **USER:**
> 1. serve npm package is fine
3. 3000 also fine
4. remove
5. http://frontend:3000 is fine
Update docs/implementation.md and README files

Perfect! I'll implement the changes to make the frontend container use a simple static file server without proxy functionality. Let me create a task list and proceed with the implementation.

Now I need to update the documentation files. Let me read the implementation.md to understand what sections need updates:

The implementation.md has extensive nginx documentation. I need to update it to reflect the new architecture. Let me make strategic updates:

Now let me update the section header and add a note about the removed nginx container:

Now let me update the README.md:

Perfect! All tasks completed. Let me create a summary document for you:

## Summary: Frontend Container Refactoring Complete ✅

I've successfully refactored the frontend Docker container to remove nginx and use a simple static file server instead. Here's what changed:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Frontend Container** ([frontend/Dockerfile](frontend/Dockerfile))
   - ✅ Replaced nginx with `serve` npm package
   - ✅ Changed from port 80 to port 3000
   - ✅ Simplified to pure static file serving (no proxy functionality)
   - ✅ Maintains SPA routing support for React Router

#### 2. **Removed Files**
   - ✅ Deleted [frontend/nginx.conf](frontend/nginx.conf) (no longer needed)

#### 3. **Docker Compose** ([docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml))
   - ✅ Removed nginx service entirely
   - ✅ Updated frontend service to expose port 3000
   - ✅ Removed nginx dependency from frontend service

#### 4. **Configuration** ([frontend/.env.example](frontend/.env.example))
   - ✅ Updated with clear instructions for external proxy setup
   - ✅ Added notes about CORS requirements for direct connections
   - ✅ Documented all deployment scenarios

#### 5. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Updated [docs/implementation.md](docs/implementation.md):
     - Added Architecture Overview section
     - Updated all deployment scenarios
     - Added example configurations for nginx, Apache, Traefik, and Caddy
     - Updated troubleshooting section
     - Removed references to containerized nginx
   
   - ✅ Updated [README.md](README.md):
     - Added external proxy requirement
     - Included example nginx configuration
     - Updated access instructions
     - Fixed project structure
     - Updated troubleshooting section

### New Architecture:

```
External Reverse Proxy (Your nginx/Apache/Traefik/Caddy)
├── /api/* → backend:8000
├── /uploads/* → backend:8000
├── /processed/* → backend:8000
└── /* → frontend:3000

Containers:
- backend:8000 (FastAPI, not exposed to host)
- frontend:3000 (serve static files, exposed to host)
```

### How to Use:

1. **Start containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Configure your external reverse proxy** (example nginx config in README.md)

3. **Access via proxy:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost/
   - Backend API: http://localhost/api/
   - Docs: http://localhost/api/docs

### Benefits:

✅ **Independent frontend** - No hardcoded backend URLs in nginx config  
✅ **Flexible deployment** - Works with any reverse proxy (nginx, Apache, Traefik, Caddy)  
✅ **Simpler container** - Just serves static files, no complex nginx configuration  
✅ **Your control** - You manage the proxy with all your other sites  
✅ **Smaller image** - Uses Alpine Node.js instead of nginx  
✅ **Consistent** - Same server in dev and prod (serve package)

All documentation has been updated to reflect the new architecture!

👤 **USER:**
> INFO  Accepting connections at http://localhost:3000
It should use 0.0.0.0

You're right! The `serve` package needs to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` to be accessible from outside the container. Let me fix that:

Perfect! I've updated the frontend Dockerfile to bind the `serve` package to `0.0.0.0:3000` instead of just `localhost:3000`. 

This change ensures that:
- The server accepts connections from outside the container (from your external reverse proxy)
- It's accessible via the Docker network
- Your external proxy can properly route requests to `http://frontend:3000`

The `tcp://0.0.0.0:3000` syntax tells `serve` to listen on all network interfaces on port 3000, which is the correct configuration for Docker containers.

👤 **USER:**
> I change my mind :) Let use an nginx as a web server for frontend container but only as web server not proxy

No problem! Let me revert back to using nginx, but configure it as a pure web server without any proxy functionality.
