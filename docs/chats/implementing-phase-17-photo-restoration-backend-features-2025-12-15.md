👤 **USER:**
> Start implement phase 1.7 as described in ROADMAP.md
Implement test cases as well
Check ROADMAP.md for done and todo items
Read CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules and instructions
All documentation regarding project can be found under root and docs/directory
Previous conversations can be found under docs/chats/ directory
for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right
At the end update README and ROADMAP files with done tasks

I'll start by reading the relevant documentation to understand the project structure, phase 1.7 requirements, and coding rules.

Let me read the AI coding rules and check previous conversations to understand the implementation context:

Now let me check the existing frontend structure to understand what's already implemented:

Perfect! Now let me check what Phase 1.7 requires and review existing implementations:

Now let me understand Phase 1.7 requirements better and propose a comprehensive solution:

## Summary of Phase 1.7 Requirements

Based on my analysis of the ROADMAP.md, Phase 1.7 requires implementing the following frontend features:

### **Image Upload Feature:**
1. `ImageUploader.tsx` - drag & drop upload component
2. `ModelSelector.tsx` - model selection dropdown
3. `ImageComparison.tsx` - before/after slider
4. `ProcessingStatus.tsx` - loading state, progress
5. `useImageRestore.ts` - restoration logic hook
6. `restorationService.ts` - API calls
7. File validation (jpg, png, max 10MB)
8. User-friendly error messages

### **History Feature:**
1. `HistoryList.tsx` - list of processed images
2. `HistoryCard.tsx` - individual history item
3. `useHistory.ts` - fetch and manage history
4. `historyService.ts` - API calls
5. Thumbnail grid view
6. View/compare, download, delete actions

### **Testing Requirements:**
- Component tests for all major components
- Hook tests for business logic
- Service tests for API calls
- Integration tests for full workflows
- Minimum 60% frontend code coverage

## Proposed Implementation Plan

I propose the following implementation approach for Phase 1.7:

### **1. Project Structure**
```
frontend/src/
├── features/
│   ├── restoration/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── ImageUploader.tsx

    ├── restoration/
    └── history/
```

### **2. Key Features**

**Image Upload & Restoration:**
- Drag & drop file upload with visual feedback
- Model selection with descriptions from API
- Real-time processing status with progress indication
- Before/after image comparison slider
- Download processed image
- Error handling for file validation, API errors

**History Management:**
- Paginated grid view of processed images
- Thumbnail previews with metadata (model, date)
- Click to view full size with before/after comparison
- Download and delete actions
- Empty state when no history exists

**Shared Components:**
- Reusable Button component (primary, secondary, gradient variants)
- Card component for consistent layout
- Loader with sqowe branding
- ErrorMessage component with user-friendly messages
- Layout with Header (logo, nav, logout) and Footer

### **3. Styling Approach**
- Follow sqowe brand guidelines strictly
- Use existing design tokens from [base.css](frontend/src/styles/base.css:1-233)
- Material-inspired interactions (elevation, transitions)
- Responsive design (mobile-first, 768px tablet, 1024px desktop)
- Consistent spacing (8px grid system)

### **4. Testing Strategy**
- Component tests: Rendering, user interactions, error states
- Hook tests: Business logic, state management, API integration
- Service tests: API calls, error handling, response parsing
- Integration tests: Complete user flows (upload→process→view→download)
- Target: 60%+ code coverage

### **5. Implementation Order**
1. **Shared components** (Button, Card, Loader, ErrorMessage, Layout)
2. **Restoration feature** (ImageUploader → ModelSelector → ProcessingStatus → ImageComparison → useImageRestore hook → restorationService → RestorationPage)
3. **History feature** (HistoryCard → HistoryList → useHistory hook → historyService → HistoryPage)
4. **Update App.tsx** with new routes and layout
5. **Tests** for each component/hook/service as they're built
6. **Integration tests** for complete workflows

### **6. Technical Considerations**
- Use existing `apiClient.ts` for authenticated requests with file upload support
- Leverage `uploadFile()` function for image uploads with progress tracking
- Reuse design tokens and CSS variables from `base.css`
- Follow TypeScript strict mode (existing standard)
- Keep components under 300 lines (per AI_FRONTEND.md)
- File size limit: 800 lines max

## Questions & Decisions Needed

Before I proceed with implementation, please confirm:

1. **Routing**: Should I add `/history` route alongside the main restoration page at `/`?
2. **Layout**: Should the header/footer be visible on all pages (including login)?
3. **Model Selection**: Should models be fetched from `/api/v1/models` or hardcoded from config?
4. **History Pagination**: What page size (default 10, 20, 50 items)?
5. **Image Comparison**: Prefer a slider component or side-by-side view with toggle?
6. **File Upload**: Show preview immediately or only after successful validation?
7. **Testing**: Should I use the existing test infrastructure (Vitest + RTL + setup.ts)?

**Would you like me to proceed with this implementation plan?** I'll start with shared components, then move to restoration features, followed by history features, and comprehensive tests for each.

Please let me know if you'd like any adjustments to this plan, or if I should proceed with implementation immediately.

👤 **USER:**
> Routing: add /history route
Layout: yes do header/footer visible
 Model Selection: Should be fetched from /api/v1/models
History Pagination: What page size - make it configurable
Image Comparison: make side-bu-side. should be 3 options. original,preview and both
Testing: Yes use existing

Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. Let me create a comprehensive implementation plan with all your specifications and then proceed with the implementation.

## Implementation Plan Summary

**Routing:**
- `/` - Main restoration page (protected)
- `/history` - History page (protected)
- `/login` - Login page (public)

**Layout:**
- Header/Footer visible on all pages
- Header: sqowe logo, navigation (Home, History), Logout button
- Footer: sqowe branding

**Model Selection:**
- Fetch from `GET /api/v1/models` API endpoint
- Display model name, description, category

**History Pagination:**
- Configurable page size (stored in config or user preference)
- Default: 20 items per page

**Image Comparison:**
- Side-by-side view with 3 options:
  - Original only
  - Processed only
  - Both (split view)

**Testing:**
- Use existing Vitest + RTL + setup.ts infrastructure

Now let me create the test file for restoration feature. Due to length constraints, I'll create a consolidated test file:

Now let me create tests for the history feature and run all tests:

Perfect! Now let me run the tests to make sure everything works:

Let me run tests using the backend venv instead:

Let me try reinstalling dependencies first:

Good! Tests are running. Let me fix the failing test:

Now let's run the tests again to see the results:

update .gitignore to not track *.bak files

I'll update the .gitignore file to exclude *.bak files:

Perfect! I've updated the `.gitignore` file to exclude `*.bak` files. This will prevent backup files (like the `ROADMAP.md.bak` file created by the sed command) from being tracked by git.
