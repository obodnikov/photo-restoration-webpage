check .uploader-hint style description.
On large screen it doesn't work

Read ROADMAP.md file with done tasks
Read CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules and instructions
All documentation regarding project can be found under root and docs/directory
Previous conversations can be found under docs/chats/ directory
for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right

I'll help you investigate the `.uploader-hint` style issue on large screens. Let me start by reading the relevant files to understand the context.

Now let me read the web design guidelines and check the HTML structure to understand the issue:

Now let me check the responsive design rules in the CSS and look at the base CSS variables:

Now I understand the issue! Looking at the CSS for `.uploader-hint` (line 100-105 in restoration.css), I can see that it's centered and has proper styling. However, looking at the screenshot you provided, the text "Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png (max 10MB)" appears to be left-aligned or not properly centered on large screens.

Let me check if there might be a responsive issue or if there's a `max-width` constraint that's causing the problem:

## Analysis

The `.uploader-hint` style at line 100-105 of [restoration.css](frontend/src/styles/components/restoration.css:100-105) has:
```css
.uploader-hint {
  font-size: var(--font-size-sm);
  color: var(--color-text-secondary);
  margin: 0;
  text-align: center;
}
```

However, looking at the parent element `.uploader-placeholder` (line 84-86), it only has `width: 100%` but no explicit flexbox centering or text alignment rules that would enforce centering on its children.

Additionally, the `<p>` tag has a global style from [base.css](frontend/src/styles/base.css:175-178) with `max-width: 70ch`, which might be causing the hint text to not properly center on large screens since the paragraph is constrained in width.

## Proposed Solution

I propose adding explicit flexbox centering to the `.uploader-placeholder` container and removing the `max-width` constraint from the hint paragraph specifically. Here's what needs to be changed:

1. Update `.uploader-placeholder` to use flexbox with centered alignment
2. Ensure the hint text doesn't inherit the global `max-width: 70ch` from paragraph styles

Would you like me to implement this fix?

I'll implement the fix for the `.uploader-hint` centering issue on large screens.

Perfect! I've implemented the fix for the `.uploader-hint` centering issue. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `.uploader-placeholder`** ([restoration.css:84-90](frontend/src/styles/components/restoration.css:84-90)):
   - Added `display: flex`
   - Added `flex-direction: column`
   - Added `align-items: center` (centers children horizontally)
   - Added `justify-content: center` (centers children vertically)

2. **Updated `.uploader-hint`** ([restoration.css:104-111](frontend/src/styles/components/restoration.css:104-111)):
   - Added `max-width: 100%` to override the global `max-width: 70ch` from paragraph styles
   - Added `width: 100%` to ensure the text takes full available width within its parent

## What This Fixes

- The flexbox layout on `.uploader-placeholder` ensures all child elements (icon, text, and hint) are properly centered both horizontally and vertically
- The `width: 100%` on `.uploader-hint` ensures the text uses the full width of its container, making the `text-align: center` work correctly on all screen sizes, including large screens

The hint text should now be properly centered on large screens. You can test this by refreshing your frontend application.
