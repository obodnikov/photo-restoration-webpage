👤 **USER:**
> I start testing implementation that was done under   docs/chats/admin-model-config-implementation-plan.md
One bug I found. On model card in attached screenshot we can see 4 tags specified. But in edit window enchancedtag not specified. in local.json file,part of it below, tags also 4

for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right

I'll investigate this bug where the tags are not displaying correctly in the edit window. Let me start by reading the relevant documentation and examining the implementation.

Now let me examine the model config implementation to understand the bug:

Now let me check the backend to see how model configs are loaded:

Now let me find where the model config data is fetched and check if there's a typo issue:

I see! There's a typo. The user mentioned "enchance" in the screenshot but couldn't find it. Let me check the production.json file to see if the typo exists there:

Now let me check if there's a local.json file with the "replicate-google-upscaler" model mentioned in the screenshot:

Perfect! I found the issue. In the file at line 107, there's a typo: "enchance" instead of "enhance". However, the user mentioned they see 4 tags in the screenshot (enchance, replicate, advanced, upscale) but in the config file I see only 3 tags. Let me search for where the actual running config might be:

Let me check what configuration the app is actually using by examining the admin endpoints:

Let me look at where the issue happens - I need to understand how the data is being loaded from the backend:

Now I understand the issue. The backend is returning the model config with the tags field correctly from line 513: `tags=model.get("tags", [])`. This means the backend is sending the correct data. The problem must be in how the frontend is handling the tags. Let me check if perhaps you're loading data from somewhere else or if the "enchance" tag (with the typo) isn't in the available tags list:

Now I found it! The issue is:

1. The model has a tag "enchance" (typo - should be "enhance") 
2. The available_tags list in [default.json:173](backend/config/default.json#L173) only includes "enhance" (correct spelling)
3. The TagSelector component only shows checkboxes for tags in the `availableTags` array
4. Since "enchance" is not in the available tags list, it won't show up in the edit dialog

The bug is that tags from the model that are NOT in the `availableTags` list are silently ignored in the UI.

## Problem Analysis

**Root Cause:** The TagSelector component only displays checkboxes for tags that exist in the `availableTags` array. If a model has a tag that's not in this predefined list (like the typo "enchance"), that tag won't be shown in the edit dialog, even though it exists in the model configuration.

**Current Behavior:**
- Model has tags: `["enchance", "replicate", "advanced", "upscale"]`
- Available tags: `["restore", "replicate", "advanced", "enhance", "upscale", "fast"]`
- TagSelector only shows checkboxes for the 6 available tags
- The "enchance" tag exists in the model but has no checkbox, so it appears unchecked/missing

## Proposed Solution

I propose two fixes:

### Fix 1: Add "enchance" to the available_tags (Quick fix for the typo)
Simply add "enchance" to the available tags list, OR correct the typo in the model configuration.

### Fix 2: Enhance TagSelector to handle custom tags (Proper fix)
Modify the TagSelector component to:
1. Show all tags from `availableTags` as checkboxes
2. Additionally show any tags from `selectedTags` that aren't in `availableTags` (these would be custom/legacy tags)
3. Mark custom tags visually differently (e.g., with a different style or label)
4. Optionally allow removing custom tags that aren't in the available list

This would prevent data loss when editing models with tags that aren't in the predefined list.

**Which approach would you prefer?**
1. Just fix the typo ("enchance" → "enhance") in the model configuration?
2. Implement the enhanced TagSelector that can handle custom tags?
3. Both - fix the typo AND enhance the component for future cases?

Thank you for the clarification! Now I understand the real issue completely.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The model in production `local.json` has the tag **"enchance"** (typo), but the `available_tags` list in `default.json` only includes **"enhance"** (correct spelling). 

The TagSelector component only renders checkboxes for tags in the `available_tags` array. Since "enchance" is not in that list, it doesn't get a checkbox in the UI. However, the tag still exists in the model data, so:

1. The model card displays all 4 tags including "enchance" (from the actual model data)
2. The edit dialog only shows checkboxes for tags in `available_tags` 
3. The "enchance" tag has no checkbox, so it appears to be missing
4. If you save without fixing this, the "enchance" tag would likely be lost

## Proposed Solution

I recommend **Option 3: Fix both the typo AND enhance the TagSelector component**

### Part 1: Fix the typo in local.json
Change "enchance" → "enhance" in the production configuration

### Part 2: Enhance TagSelector to prevent future data loss
Modify [TagSelector.tsx](frontend/src/features/admin/components/TagSelector.tsx) to:
1. Show checkboxes for all `availableTags`
2. **Additionally** show any tags from `selectedTags` that aren't in `availableTags` (custom/legacy tags)
3. Mark these custom tags differently (e.g., different color, with "(custom)" label)
4. Allow users to see and remove these non-standard tags

This prevents silent data loss when editing models with tags that aren't in the predefined list, which is exactly what's happening now.

**Would you like me to implement both fixes?**

👤 **USER:**
> I am little bit confused. You mentioned "Show checkboxes for all availableTags" doe it mean that currently it show something hardoced but not from config file?

Good question! Let me clarify by tracing through the code flow:

Perfect! Now I can see the full flow. Let me trace it:

Now I can answer your question clearly:

## Current Flow (NOT hardcoded)

**The tags ARE coming from the config file**, here's the flow:

1. **Backend** ([config.py:425-429](backend/app/core/config.py#L425-L429)): 
   - Reads `available_tags` from `default.json` → `["restore", "replicate", "advanced", "enhance", "upscale", "fast"]`
   - Falls back to hardcoded list only if config missing

2. **API** ([admin.py:769](backend/app/api/v1/routes/admin.py#L769)):
   - Endpoint `/api/v1/admin/models/tags` returns the tags from config

3. **Frontend** ([modelConfigService.ts:60-63](frontend/src/features/admin/services/modelConfigService.ts#L60-L63)):
   - Fetches tags from the API endpoint

4. **TagSelector** ([TagSelector.tsx:37](frontend/src/features/admin/components/TagSelector.tsx#L37)):
   - Renders checkboxes ONLY for tags in the `availableTags` prop (which came from config)

## The Problem

So it's **NOT hardcoded**, but there's still a bug:

- Config file has: `["restore", "replicate", "advanced", "enhance", "upscale", "fast"]` (correct spelling)
- Model has: `["enchance", "replicate", "advanced", "upscale"]` (typo in first tag)
- TagSelector only shows checkboxes for the 6 tags from config
- The "enchance" tag doesn't match any of these, so it has no checkbox
- Result: The tag exists in the model but is invisible in the edit dialog

**My proposed fix is correct**: Enhance TagSelector to also show tags from `selectedTags` that aren't in `availableTags`, so users can see (and remove) non-standard tags like "enchance".

Does this clarify the issue?

👤 **USER:**
> Yes - all is fine

Great! Now that we've confirmed the issue, let me propose the complete solution:

## Solution: Enhance TagSelector to Handle Non-Standard Tags

### Changes Needed:

1. **Fix the typo in production** - Change "enchance" → "enhance" in `/opt/retro/config/local.json`
2. **Enhance TagSelector component** - Show non-standard tags so this doesn't happen again

### Implementation Plan:

**Modified TagSelector will:**
- Show checkboxes for all tags in `availableTags` (from config)
- **Additionally** show any tags from `selectedTags` that aren't in `availableTags` 
- Mark non-standard tags visually (different color/style + "(custom)" label)
- Allow users to see and uncheck these custom tags

**Benefits:**
- No data loss when editing models with typos or legacy tags
- Users can see all tags currently on the model
- Clear visual indication of which tags are non-standard
- Users can remove problematic tags through the UI

### Files to modify:
1. [TagSelector.tsx](frontend/src/features/admin/components/TagSelector.tsx) - Add logic to display custom tags
2. CSS file - Add styling for custom tags (different color/badge)

**Would you like me to proceed with implementing this solution?**
