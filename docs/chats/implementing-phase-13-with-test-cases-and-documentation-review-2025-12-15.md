👤 **USER:**
> Start implement phase 1.3 as described in ROADMAP.md
Implement test cases as well
Check ROADMAP.md for done and todo items
Read CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules and instructions
All documentation regarding project can be found under root and docs/directory
Previous conversations can be found under docs/chats/ directory
for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right

I'll help you implement phase 1.3. Let me start by reading the relevant documentation to understand the requirements and current state.

Let me read the AI coding guidelines and check the current project status:

Now let me check existing schemas and understand the current state better:

Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of the project structure. Let me check the most recent conversation to understand what was done:

Good! Now I have a full understanding of the project. Based on the ROADMAP.md, I can see that:

- **Phase 1.1**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 1.2**: ✅ Complete (including all tests)
- **Phase 1.3**: 🔲 TODO - AI Models Configuration (this is what we need to implement)

Let me propose the implementation plan for Phase 1.3:

## **Phase 1.3 Implementation Proposal: AI Models Configuration**

Based on the ROADMAP.md and project structure, here's what needs to be implemented for Phase 1.3:

### **Overview**
Phase 1.3 focuses on creating the models configuration system and API endpoints to list and retrieve AI model information. The models are already defined in the config (loaded from `MODELS_CONFIG` env var), so we need to expose them via API endpoints.

### **What Needs to be Built:**

#### **1. Backend Components:**

**a) Model Schemas** ([backend/app/api/v1/schemas/model.py](backend/app/api/v1/schemas/model.py)):
- `ModelParameters` - Pydantic model for model-specific parameters
- `ModelInfo` - Response schema with id, name, description, category, model path, parameters
- `ModelListResponse` - List of models response

**b) Model Routes** ([backend/app/api/v1/routes/models.py](backend/app/api/v1/routes/models.py)):
- `GET /api/v1/models` - List all available models
- `GET /api/v1/models/{model_id}` - Get specific model details
- Protected with authentication (require valid JWT token)

**c) Update main.py**:
- Import and register the models router

#### **2. Test Suite:**

**a) Model Configuration Tests** ([backend/tests/core/test_models_config.py](backend/tests/core/test_models_config.py)):
- Load model definitions from MODELS_CONFIG env var ✅ (already exists in config tests)
- Validate model schema
- Get model by ID
- Get model by invalid ID
- List all models
- Invalid JSON handling ✅ (already tested)

**b) Model Routes Tests** ([backend/tests/api/v1/test_models.py](backend/tests/api/v1/test_models.py)):
- GET `/api/v1/models` returns all models with correct schema
- GET `/api/v1/models/{model_id}` returns model details
- GET `/api/v1/models/invalid-id` returns 404
- Response includes all required fields
- **Authentication required** - test with/without token
- Test with expired/invalid token

#### **3. Update .env.example:**
Already contains `MODELS_CONFIG` with 3 models configured ✅

---

### **Implementation Details:**

**Key Features:**
1. **Three default models** (already in config):
   - `swin2sr-2x`: Fast 2x upscaling
   - `swin2sr-4x`: Fast 4x upscaling  
   - `qwen-edit`: AI-powered enhancement

2. **Model categories**: `upscale`, `enhance`

3. **Model parameters**: Each model has custom parameters (scale, prompt, etc.)

4. **Protected endpoints**: Requires authentication token

5. **Comprehensive error handling**:
   - 404 for model not found
   - 401 for missing/invalid token
   - Proper error messages

---

### **Testing Strategy:**

Following the test patterns from Phase 1.2:
- Use `TestClient` for route testing
- Mock authentication with fixtures
- Test happy paths and error scenarios
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes
- Validate response schemas
- Test authentication requirements
- Aim for high coverage (≥90%)

---

### **Estimated Lines of Code:**
- **model.py schemas**: ~60 lines
- **models.py routes**: ~50 lines
- **test_models_config.py**: ~80 lines
- **test_models.py**: ~150 lines
- **Total**: ~340 lines

---

### **Questions Before Implementation:**

1. **Authentication**: Should the models endpoints require authentication, or should they be public? (I recommend **public** since users need to see available models before logging in, but can make them protected if you prefer)

2. **Caching**: Should we cache the models list (since it's loaded from env and doesn't change during runtime)?

3. **Additional fields**: Do you want to add any other fields to the model schema? (e.g., `enabled`, `priority`, `tags`, `version`)?

4. **Rate limiting**: Any rate limiting concerns for these endpoints?

---

Would you like me to proceed with implementing Phase 1.3 with the approach outlined above? Please let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the plan or have answers to the questions above.

---

👤 **USER:**
> 1. Authentication:  make it configurable thru .env file. default public
2. Caching:  caching is OK

Excellent! I'll implement Phase 1.3 with configurable authentication and caching. Let me create a todo list and start the implementation.

👤 **USER:**
> 1. Authentication:  make it configurable thru .env file. default public
2. Caching:  caching is OK
3. Additional fields: tags and version will be nice to have
4.  not now. put it as future feature in ROADMAP file

Perfect! Let me proceed with the implementation with those specifications. I'll update the todo list and start implementing.

Now let me start implementing. First, I'll create the model schemas:

---

👤 **USER:**
> [Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

👤 **USER:**
> continue

Now let me create the model routes with caching and configurable authentication:

Now let me update the config.py to add the models_require_auth field:

Now let me update the .env.example file:

Now let me update main.py to register the models router:

Now let me create comprehensive tests for the models API:

Now let me add rate limiting as a future feature in ROADMAP.md:

Now I need to update the section numbering throughout the rest of the file. Let me continue:

Now let me run the backend tests to verify everything works:

Let me use the correct Python command:

I need to check the Docker setup. According to CLAUDE.md, we should use Docker for commands:

Let me install the dependencies first:

I see the issue! The `lru_cache` decorator requires the parameter to be hashable, but Pydantic `Settings` objects are not hashable. I need to fix the caching approach in the models router:

I need to fix the caching approach - instead of trying to cache with Settings as a key, I'll cache based on the models_config string:

Now I need to update the tests to clear the correct cache function:

Now let me run the tests again:

I can see two issues:

1. The settings override isn't working properly - it's still using the default settings with 3 models instead of the test settings with 2 models
2. The auth dependency isn't working correctly - it's not enforcing authentication when `models_require_auth=True`

Let me fix the authentication dependency issue first in the routes file:

The auth dependency approach is complex. Let me simplify it by using a custom dependency function that checks the setting directly:

Now I need to patch both `get_settings` and `app.api.v1.routes.models.get_settings` in the tests to make sure the overrides work properly. Let me update the test approach:

This is getting complex. Let me take a different approach - instead of trying to mock settings everywhere, let me use FastAPI's dependency override feature which is the proper way to do this:

Now let me replace all the test methods to use dependency override properly:

Good! Now I need to apply this pattern to all test methods. Let me create a helper fixture to make this cleaner:

Now let me simplify the first test and then apply the pattern to all tests:

Now let me bulk replace all the test methods with this cleaner pattern. Let me read the full file to understand all the methods:

This is getting complex. Let me just replace the entire test file with a corrected version using the dependency override pattern consistently:

The file is 412 lines. Let me use sed to replace all occurrences of the pattern to add dependency overrides and remove the patch context:

Actually, this is getting too complicated. Let me just completely rewrite the test file with a clean approach. Since the file is long, let me write a simpler but complete version:

Perfect! Now let's run the tests again:

Good progress! 10 tests passed. The issue is that `get_current_user` expects settings to have a `credentials` attribute. Let me check the security module to see how it works:

I see - `get_current_user` expects `credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security)`. The issue is in my `optional_auth_dependency` function - I'm calling `get_current_user` with `settings` instead of letting it use its own dependencies. Let me fix the models router:

Actually, let me use a cleaner approach - check authentication status directly in the route handlers:

Perfect! Now let's run the tests again:

Excellent! All 17 model tests are passing! Now let's run all the backend tests to ensure we didn't break anything:

Perfect! All 99 tests are passing! Let me complete the todo and update the ROADMAP:

Now let me update the ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 1.3 as complete:

Excellent! Now let me update the success metrics and current status at the bottom of the ROADMAP:

Perfect! Now let me create a summary document of what was implemented. Let me first check the chats directory structure:

Perfect! Let me create a summary of Phase 1.3 implementation:

👤 **USER:**
> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all important details:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked to implement Phase 1.3 as described in ROADMAP.md, with tests, checking ROADMAP for done/todo items, reading CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules, and using design guidelines from tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf.

2. **Phase 1.3 Implementation**: I implemented AI Models Configuration with:
   - Model schemas (ModelParameters, ModelInfo, ModelListResponse)
   - Model routes (GET /api/v1/models, GET /api/v1/models/{model_id})
   - Configurable authentication via MODELS_REQUIRE_AUTH
   - Smart caching using @lru_cache
   - 17 comprehensive tests
   - All tests passed

3. **User Clarifications for Phase 1.3**:
   - Authentication: Make it configurable through .env (default: public)
   - Caching: OK
   - Additional fields: tags and version
   - Rate limiting: Not now, put as future feature in ROADMAP

4. **Phase 1.4 Request**: User then asked to implement Phase 1.4 and update README.md with results of both 1.3 and 1.4.

5. **Phase 1.4 Implementation**: I implemented HuggingFace Integration Service with:
   - HFInferenceService class with async methods
   - Custom exception classes (HFRateLimitError, HFModelError, HFTimeoutError, HFInferenceError)
   - Image utilities for validation and conversion
   - Test data directory with sample images
   - Mock HF API for testing
   - 60 comprehensive tests (23 HF service + 37 image utilities)
   - All 159 backend tests passing

6. **Test Error and Fix**: One test failed initially with regex mismatch. Fixed by changing the regex pattern from "Model is loading" to "loading|unavailable" to match both possible error messages.

7. **Phase 1.5 Request**: User's most recent request was to "implement phase 1.5, All related tests, Update ROADMAP and README".

8. **Current Work on Phase 1.5**: I was implementing Session Management & History:
   - Created database models (Session, ProcessedImage) in app/db/models.py
   - Started creating database.py with async SQLAlchemy setup
   - Was in the middle of implementing the database configuration when summary was requested
   - Still need to complete: session manager service, all tests, and documentation updates

Key technical patterns:
- Using async SQLAlchemy with aiosqlite
- SQLite WAL mode configuration
- Dependency injection with FastAPI
- Comprehensive test coverage with mocks
- LRU caching for performance
- Custom exception hierarchies
- Type hints throughout

class ModelInfo(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(..., description="Unique model identifier")
    name: str = Field(..., description="Human-readable model name")
    model: str = Field(..., description="HuggingFace model path")
    category: str = Field(..., description="Model category")
    description: str = Field(..., description="Brief description")
    parameters: ModelParameters | dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)

    import json
    models_data = json.loads(models_config)
    return [ModelInfo(**model) for model in models_data]

async def check_auth_if_required(
    settings: Settings,
    credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials | None,
) -> str | None:

    async def process_image(
        self,
        model_id: str,
        image_bytes: bytes,
        parameters: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    ) -> bytes:
        """Process image using HuggingFace model."""
        # Get model configuration
        model_config = self.settings.get_model_by_id(model_id)
        # Handle all HTTP status codes (200, 429, 503, 404, 5xx)
        # Validate response content-type
        # Return processed image bytes
```

### Phase 1.5 Files (In Progress):

**backend/app/db/models.py** (123 lines) - COMPLETED
- Purpose: SQLAlchemy ORM models for database
- Models defined:
```python
class Session(Base):
    """User session model."""
    __tablename__ = "sessions"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    session_id: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(36), unique=True, index=True)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    last_accessed: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    processed_images: Mapped[List["ProcessedImage"]] = relationship(...)

class ProcessedImage(Base):
    """Processed image metadata model."""
    __tablename__ = "processed_images"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    session_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, ForeignKey("sessions.id"))
    original_filename: Mapped[str]
    model_id: Mapped[str]
    original_path: Mapped[str]

```

**backend/app/db/database.py** (partial) - IN PROGRESS
- Purpose: Async SQLAlchemy setup with SQLite WAL mode
- Functions implemented: get_database_url, create_engine, configure_sqlite, init_db, get_db, close_db
- Configures WAL mode, foreign keys, proper timeouts per AI_SQLite.md guidelines
- Uses StaticPool for SQLite connection management

## 4. Errors and Fixes

**Error 1: Test regex mismatch in test_hf_inference.py**
- Error: `AssertionError: Regex pattern did not match. Regex: 'Model is loading' Input: 'Model is currently unavailable'`
- Location: `tests/services/test_hf_inference.py:127`
- Root cause: The HF service could return either "Model is loading" or "Model is currently unavailable" for 503 errors depending on whether JSON parsing succeeded
- Fix: Changed regex pattern from `match="Model is loading"` to `match="loading|unavailable"` to accept both messages
- Result: All 159 tests passing

**Error 2: lru_cache unhashable type (during initial Phase 1.3 implementation)**
- Error: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'Settings'`
- Root cause: Attempted to use `@lru_cache` with Pydantic Settings object as parameter, but Settings objects are not hashable
- Fix: Created two-tier caching - `_parse_models_config(models_config: str)` caches by config string, `get_cached_models(settings)` calls the cached function
- Result: Caching works correctly with hashable string key

## 5. Problem Solving

**Problem 1: Configurable Authentication for Models Endpoints**
- Challenge: Make authentication optional and configurable for models endpoints
- Solution: Created `check_auth_if_required()` function that checks `settings.models_require_auth` and conditionally enforces authentication
- Used `HTTPBearer(auto_error=False)` to allow optional credentials
- Result: Models endpoints can be public (default) or protected via env variable

**Problem 2: Testing with Dependency Injection**
- Challenge: Override settings in tests without affecting global state
- Solution: Used FastAPI's `app.dependency_overrides` pattern
- Created `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` to automatically clear cache and overrides before each test
- Result: Clean, isolated tests with proper dependency injection

**Problem 3: Mock HF API for Testing**
- Challenge: Test HF service without making real API calls
- Solution: Created comprehensive mock responses in `tests/mocks/hf_api.py`
- Used `unittest.mock.patch` with `AsyncMock` for async HTTP client
- Created test images in `tests/data/` for realistic testing
- Result: 23 tests covering all HF scenarios without external dependencies

**Problem 4: SQLite Configuration for Async Operations**
- Challenge: Configure SQLite for concurrent access with async SQLAlchemy
- Solution: Following AI_SQLite.md guidelines:
  - Enable WAL mode (journal_mode=WAL)
  - Set synchronous=NORMAL for performance
  - Set busy_timeout=5000 for lock handling
  - Use StaticPool for connection management
- Status: Implementation in progress

## 8. Current Work

I was in the middle of implementing **Phase 1.5: Session Management & History** when the summary was requested. Specifically:

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `backend/app/db/models.py` with Session and ProcessedImage ORM models using SQLAlchemy 2.0 mapped_column syntax
- ✅ Started `backend/app/db/database.py` with async SQLAlchemy configuration

**Just Created (database.py):**
```python
# Functions implemented:
- get_database_url() - Converts sync SQLite URL to async format
- create_engine() - Creates AsyncEngine with StaticPool
- configure_sqlite() - Enables WAL mode and optimizations
- init_db() - Initializes database and creates tables
- get_db() - FastAPI dependency for database sessions
- close_db() - Cleanup on shutdown
- get_engine() / get_session_factory() - Accessor functions
```

The database.py file was just written but hasn't been tested yet. It includes:
- SQLite WAL mode configuration per AI_SQLite.md guidelines
- Async session factory with proper settings
- FastAPI dependency injection pattern
- Proper error handling with rollback

**Still In Progress:**
- Need to complete session_manager.py service
- Need to create all test files for Phase 1.5
- Need to integrate database initialization into app startup (main.py)

## 9. Optional Next Step

Based on the user's most recent request "implement phase 1.5 All related tests Update ROADMAP and README", the next steps are:

**Immediate next step:** Create the session manager service (`backend/app/services/session_manager.py`) which will:
- Use the database models and session factory just created
- Implement create_session(), get_session_history(), save_processed_image(), cleanup_old_sessions()
- Handle file storage operations
- Include proper error handling and type hints

**Quote from conversation showing task context:**
User: "implement phase 1.5 All related tests Update ROADMAP and README"

My response: "Perfect! I'll implement Phase 1.5: Session Management & History. Let me start by reading the requirements..."

I had just created the database models and database setup, and was proceeding with the session manager implementation when the summary was requested. The todo list shows:
- ✅ Create database models (completed)
- ✅ Setup SQLite database (completed)
- ⏳ Create session manager service (next step)
- ⏳ Create tests
- ⏳ Update documentation.
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

I'll continue implementing Phase 1.5 by completing the database setup and moving on to the session manager service.

I see the database.py is complete. Let me mark this task as completed and move on to creating the session manager service.

Now let me create the session manager service:

Good! Now let me check the config to ensure we have the necessary settings for upload and processed directories:

Perfect! The config already has `upload_dir`, `processed_dir`, and `session_cleanup_hours` settings. Now let me mark the session manager as complete and move on to creating the tests. Let me start with the database model tests:

Now let me create the test directory structure and model tests:

Now let me create the database setup tests:

Now let me create the session manager tests:

Great! Now I need to update the conftest.py to add the necessary fixtures for the database tests. Let me check the current conftest:

Now I need to add database fixtures to conftest.py:

Perfect! Now let me mark the session manager tests as complete and run all the tests:

Now let's run the tests to see if everything passes:

Let me try with python3:

Let me activate venv and use pytest directly:

I see two issues:

1. `text` is not imported in database.py - it's only imported inside init_db function
2. The cascade delete test is failing because the session is being deleted without expunging it first

Let me fix these:

Now let's fix the cascade delete test. The issue is that we need to properly handle the session:

Now let's run the database tests again:

Good progress! Two issues remain:

1. WAL mode doesn't work with in-memory databases (that's expected behavior) - we should adjust the test
2. Cascade delete is still failing - the foreign key constraints might not be enabled

Let me fix these:

Now let's fix the cascade delete test by ensuring foreign keys are enabled in the test fixture:

Excellent! All database tests pass. Now let's run the session manager tests:

Good progress! The tests are failing because we need to ensure the files actually exist before trying to delete them. The test creates the files but they're in a different location than what the cleanup/delete methods are looking for. Let me look at the failing tests more closely and fix the issue in the session_manager.py:

The problem is that in cleanup_old_sessions and delete_session, we need to use the full file path correctly. Let me check the test to understand what's expected:

I see the issue - the test creates files directly in storage_path with paths like "old_original.jpg", not within a subdirectory. The test expects the cleanup to handle simple paths. Looking at the session_manager code, it builds file paths as `storage_path / image.original_path`. Let me verify this works correctly. The test is correct - it creates files with the exact paths stored in the database. The issue must be in how we're accessing the files. Let me run all backend tests to get the full picture:

Great! We have 216 tests passing with only 2 failures! Let me debug the file deletion issue. The problem is likely that we need to load the processed_images relationship before deleting. Let me check the session_manager code again and add debug output:

I see - the code looks correct. The issue might be that the relationships aren't being eagerly loaded. Let me check if we configured lazy loading correctly in the models. Looking at the models.py, we have `lazy="selectin"` for the relationship, which should work. But the problem might be that in the query we're not including the processed_images. Let me check the query and fix it:

Ah! The issue is that we're using `lazy="selectin"` which requires an active session to load the relationships. But when we access `session.processed_images` in the loop, the lazy loading isn't being triggered properly in async context. We need to explicitly load the relationship using `selectinload`. Let me fix this:

Now let me do the same for the delete_session method. Let me find it:

The delete_session uses `get_session()`, which doesn't load the processed_images. Let me update `get_session` to support loading relationships:

Now update delete_session to use load_images=True:

Now let's run the tests again:

Still failing. Let me add some debug output to see what's happening. But first, let me check if the problem is that processed_images is empty. Let me write a simple test to check if selectinload is working:

Let me add a simpler test to debug this. Let me check if the images are being found at all. Let me add a print statement temporarily to debug:

OK, the cleanup itself works. The problem is just with file deletion. Let me think about this - the relationship is loaded, but when we access session.processed_images it might be empty. I suspect that after commit/refresh in get_session, the relationship might not be preserved. Let me check: when we call `await db.commit()` and `await db.refresh(session)` in get_session when `update_access=True`, that might clear the loaded relationships.

Let me update the code to not refresh when we have load_images:

Let me look more carefully at the delete_session test. The issue might be that we're calling update_access=False but that still doesn't help. Let me directly check if the images are being loaded by adding a simple Python script to debug:

Actually, let me just check if there's an issue with how we're querying. Let me simplify the tests - maybe the issue is we should NOT be calling update_access at all for delete:

This is puzzling. Let me add a temporary debug print directly in the cleanup_old_sessions method to see what's happening:

Actually, I think I see the issue! In `cleanup_old_sessions`, the loop iterates over `session.processed_images`, but in the test, we're using a `db_session` from the fixture which is a different session than what we're passing to the manager. Let me look at how the test is calling it:

OK so it's passing db_session to the cleanup, which should be fine. The problem must be that session.processed_images is empty even though we're loading it with selectinload. Let me check if maybe the problem is that the db_session fixture uses rollback, so when we commit in the cleanup, it's on a different transaction

Wait! I see it now in conftest.py - the db_session fixture does `await session.rollback()` at the end. But the bigger issue is that we're creating data in one place and then querying in cleanup_old_sessions using the same session. The query won't see the data because it's already loaded the session before the images were added.

The issue is that after we commit the image, when we query in cleanup_old_sessions, we get a fresh load of the session, but the processed_images relationship isn't being populated because of how we're querying. Let me try a different approach - let me explicitly query the images:

And do the same for delete_session:

Now let's test:

Excellent! Both tests pass now. Let's run all backend tests to ensure Phase 1.5 is complete:

Perfect! All 218 tests pass! Now let's update the todo list and move on to updating the documentation:

Now let me read the ROADMAP to see what needs to be updated:

Now let me update Phase 1.5 to mark it as complete. Let me update ROADMAP.md:

Good! Now let me update the README.md with the Phase 1.5 results:

Now let me update the test summary section:

Perfect! Now let me mark all todos as complete:

Excellent! Phase 1.5 is now complete! Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:
