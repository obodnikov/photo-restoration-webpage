> CHeck styles for forntend. For app-header specified padding: var(--space-sm) 0;
But actualy chrome calculate it as 32px that huge enough. 
Find and solve issue

Read ROADMAP.md file with done tasks
Read CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules and instructions
All documentation regarding project can be found under root and docs/directory
Previous conversations can be found under docs/chats/ directory
for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right

I'll help you investigate the CSS styling issue with the app-header padding. Let me start by examining the relevant files to understand the problem.

Now let me examine the CSS variables to understand what `--space-sm` should be:

Now I understand the issue! Looking at the CSS:

- **Line 84** in [base.css](frontend/src/styles/base.css#L84): `--space-sm: 0.5rem; /* 8px */`
- **Line 296** in [shared.css](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L296): `.header-content { padding: var(--space-xs) 0; }`

But according to your screenshot, Chrome is calculating the padding as **32px**, which corresponds to `--space-xl` (2rem = 32px from line 87 of base.css).

Let me check if there's another style file that might be overriding this or if there's an issue with how the styles are applied:

There are two files with `.app-header` styles! Let me check the layout.css file:

Found it! There's a **conflict** between two CSS files:

1. **[layout.css:117-122](frontend/src/styles/layout.css#L117-L122)**: `.app-header { padding: var(--space-xl); }` (32px)
2. **[shared.css:284-296](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L284-L296)**: `.app-header` with `.header-content { padding: var(--space-xs) 0; }`

The issue is that **[layout.css](frontend/src/styles/layout.css#L120)** is setting `padding: var(--space-xl)` (32px) directly on `.app-header`, which is overriding the intended design from shared.css.

Let me check which CSS file is loaded last and check for the web design guidelines:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. Let me check the App.tsx to see the order of CSS imports:

## Problem Analysis

I've identified the CSS styling issue with the app-header padding:

### **Root Cause:**
There's a **CSS specificity conflict** between two stylesheets:

1. **[layout.css:117-120](frontend/src/styles/layout.css#L117-L120)**: `.app-header { padding: var(--space-xl); }` → **32px padding**
2. **[shared.css:284-296](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L284-L296)**: `.app-header` with nested `.header-content { padding: var(--space-xs) 0; }`

Since both files are imported in [App.tsx](frontend/src/app/App.tsx) (line 14: layout.css, line 15: shared.css), the **layout.css** rule for `.app-header` with `padding: var(--space-xl)` (32px) is being applied, instead of the intended design from shared.css.

### **Expected Behavior:**
- According to [shared.css:296](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L296), `.header-content` should have `padding: var(--space-xs) 0;` which equals **4px 0**
- However, the parent `.app-header` has `padding: var(--space-xl)` (32px) from layout.css, which is overriding or adding to the total padding

### **Actual Behavior:**
- Chrome DevTools shows **32px padding** on `.app-header` because layout.css sets it directly

---

## **Proposed Solution:**

I recommend **removing the conflicting `.app-header` styles from layout.css** since:
1. The comprehensive header design is already defined in [shared.css:284-348](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L284-L348)
2. Layout.css should focus on general layout utilities (containers, grids, flex) rather than specific component styling
3. This follows separation of concerns: shared.css for components, layout.css for layout utilities

**Changes needed:**
- Remove or comment out lines 117-122 from [layout.css](frontend/src/styles/layout.css#L117-L122)

Would you like me to **implement this fix** by removing the conflicting styles from layout.css?

👤 **USER:**
> comment in layout

I'll comment out the conflicting `.app-header` styles in layout.css to resolve the padding issue.

Perfect! I've commented out the conflicting `.app-header` styles in [layout.css:117-123](frontend/src/styles/layout.css#L117-L123).

## Fix Applied

The conflicting CSS rule that was setting `padding: var(--space-xl)` (32px) on `.app-header` has been commented out. Now the header styling from [shared.css:284-296](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L284-L296) will be applied correctly, where `.header-content` has `padding: var(--space-xs) 0;` (4px 0).

**Result:**
- The app-header padding should now be **4px** (from `--space-xs`) instead of **32px** (from `--space-xl`)
- Refresh your browser to see the updated styles

The header should now have much less vertical padding, matching the intended design from the sqowe brand guidelines.
