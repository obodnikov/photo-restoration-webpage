Implement phase 1.8
Read ROADMAP.md file with done tasks
Read CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules and instructions
All documentation regarding project can be found under root and docs/directory
Previous conversations can be found under docs/chats/ directory
for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right

I'll start by reading the ROADMAP.md file to understand what Phase 1.8 entails and what tasks have been completed.

Now let me read the AI files and check what's already been done in Phase 1.7 to understand what remains for Phase 1.8:

Now let me check what's already implemented to better understand what needs to be done for Phase 1.8:

Perfect! I can see that the user has selected the `.uploader-hint` class at line 104 in the restoration.css file. Now let me analyze Phase 1.8 requirements and check what's already been implemented:

Now let me check what shared components already exist:

Based on my analysis of the ROADMAP.md and the existing codebase, I can see what needs to be done for **Phase 1.8: Frontend - UI/UX Implementation**. Let me provide a comprehensive proposal:

## Phase 1.8 Implementation Analysis

Looking at the ROADMAP and existing code, I can see that:

**Already Completed:**
- ✅ Layout component with Header and Footer ([Layout.tsx](frontend/src/app/Layout.tsx))
- ✅ Button component with variants ([Button.tsx](frontend/src/components/Button.tsx))
- ✅ Card component ([Card.tsx](frontend/src/components/Card.tsx))
- ✅ Loader component ([Loader.tsx](frontend/src/components/Loader.tsx))
- ✅ ErrorMessage component ([ErrorMessage.tsx](frontend/src/components/ErrorMessage.tsx))
- ✅ Base CSS with design tokens ([base.css](frontend/src/styles/base.css))
- ✅ Layout CSS with responsive grid ([layout.css](frontend/src/styles/layout.css))
- ✅ Shared component styles ([shared.css](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css))
- ✅ Montserrat font integration
- ✅ sqowe brand colors and design system
- ✅ Responsive design breakpoints

**Still Needs to be Done for Phase 1.8:**
1. **Missing Shared Components:**
   - ❌ Input component (form input)
   - ❌ Modal component (dialog)

2. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - ❌ Mobile responsive navigation (hamburger menu)
   - ❌ Improved mobile layout for existing pages
   - ❌ Better touch targets for mobile
   - ❌ Refinements based on brand guidelines

3. **Tests for Phase 1.8:**
   - ❌ Shared component tests (Button, Card, Input, Modal, Loader, ErrorMessage)
   - ❌ Layout tests (Header, Navigation, Footer, responsive behavior)
   - ❌ Page integration tests
   - ❌ Accessibility tests

## Proposed Implementation Plan

I propose implementing Phase 1.8 with the following tasks:

### 1. **Missing Shared Components**
   - Create `Input.tsx` component with form validation support
   - Create `Modal.tsx` component for dialogs and confirmations
   - Add corresponding styles to `shared.css`

### 2. **Mobile Navigation Enhancement**
   - Add hamburger menu for mobile devices
   - Improve touch targets (minimum 44x44px)
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### 3. **Responsive Design Refinements**
   - Review and enhance mobile layouts for all pages
   - Test across mobile (320px-767px), tablet (768px-1023px), desktop (1024px+)
   - Ensure proper spacing and readability at all breakpoints

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Write tests for all shared components
   - Write layout tests (header, navigation, footer)
   - Write responsive design tests
   - Write accessibility tests (ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus states)

### 5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update component documentation
   - Add usage examples for new components

Would you like me to proceed with implementing Phase 1.8 following this plan? I'll:
1. Create the missing Input and Modal components
2. Enhance mobile navigation with hamburger menu
3. Write comprehensive tests for all UI components
4. Verify responsive design across all breakpoints
5. Ensure accessibility standards are met

Please confirm if you'd like me to start the implementation, or if you'd like to adjust the scope of work.

👤 **USER:**
> Yes do it. At the end update ROADMAP and README files

I'll implement Phase 1.8 now. Let me start by creating a todo list to track the work, then proceed with the implementation.

Now let's start with creating the Input component:

Now let's add the form styles to shared.css:

Now let's create the Modal component and mark the Input component as complete:

Now let's enhance the Layout component with mobile hamburger menu:

Now let's add the mobile menu styles to shared.css:

Now let's mark that task as complete and start working on the comprehensive tests. First, let me create a test file for shared components:

Now let's create layout tests:

Now let's create accessibility tests:

Now we need to install jest-axe for accessibility testing. Let me check the package.json and add it:

Now let's mark the accessibility tests as complete and update the ROADMAP.md:

Now let's update the status at the end of the ROADMAP and update README:

Now let's update the README.md:

Perfect! Now let's mark the last todo as complete:

Excellent! Phase 1.8 is now complete. Let me create a summary document of what was accomplished:
