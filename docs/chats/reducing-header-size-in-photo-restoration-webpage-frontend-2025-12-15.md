Would like to improve little bit and check frontend after 
header on screenshot is huge. reduce it to fit text with reasonable pads

Read ROADMAP.md file with done tasks
Read CLAUDE.md and AI*.md files for rules and instructions
All documentation regarding project can be found under root and docs/directory
Previous conversations can be found under docs/chats/ directory
for all web design rules use tmp/AI_WEB_DESIGN_SQOWE.md and tmp/Brand-Guidelines.pdf files as referal. Also check already implemented styles. They are right

I'll help you reduce the header size to better fit the text with reasonable padding. Let me first read the relevant documentation and examine the current implementation.

I'll help you reduce the header size on your photo restoration webpage. Let me first examine the current header implementation in the frontend code.

Now let me check for any specific header styles in the shared components CSS:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Based on the screenshot and the code, the header is taking up too much vertical space. Looking at the styles:

1. The header has `padding: var(--space-lg) 0;` (24px top/bottom) in `.header-content` (line 296)
2. The logo text is `font-size: var(--font-size-2xl)` (24px) (line 312)
3. There's additional spacing from the subtitle

## Solution Proposal

I'll reduce the header size by:

1. **Reduce header padding** from `--space-lg` (24px) to `--space-md` (16px) or `--space-sm` (8px)
2. **Reduce logo text size** from `--font-size-2xl` (24px) to `--font-size-xl` (20px)
3. **Reduce logo subtitle size** from `--font-size-sm` (14px) to `--font-size-xs` (12px)
4. **Reduce spacing between logo text and subtitle** from 4px to 2px

This will make the header more compact and proportional while maintaining readability and the sqowe brand aesthetics.

Would you like me to implement these changes to reduce the header size?

👤 **USER:**
> points 2 and 3 fine and can be state as is. right now header.app-header have heght = 162.4  and div.container inside it 98.4. Is it possible to reduce header.app-header heght to around 100?

Yes, definitely! Let me analyze the current spacing and reduce the header height to around 100px.

Looking at the current structure:
- `.app-header` total height: 162.4px
- `.container` inside: 98.4px
- The difference (64px) is coming from the `.header-content` padding

Currently `.header-content` has `padding: var(--space-lg) 0;` which is 24px top and bottom (48px total), plus the container's padding.

To get the header to around 100px, I'll:

1. **Reduce `.header-content` padding** from `var(--space-lg)` (24px) to `var(--space-sm)` (8px) - saving ~32px
2. **Reduce logo text size** from `--font-size-2xl` (24px) to `--font-size-xl` (20px)
3. **Reduce logo subtitle size** from `--font-size-sm` (14px) to `--font-size-xs` (12px)
4. **Reduce margin-top between logo text and subtitle** from 4px to 2px

This should bring the header down to approximately 90-100px total height.

**Would you like me to implement these changes now?**

👤 **USER:**
> yes implement

Perfect! I've successfully reduced the header size. Here's what was changed in [shared.css](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css):

**Changes made:**

1. **`.header-content` padding**: Reduced from `var(--space-lg)` (24px) to `var(--space-sm)` (8px) - saves ~32px in total height
2. **`.logo-text` font-size**: Reduced from `var(--font-size-2xl)` (24px) to `var(--font-size-xl)` (20px) - saves ~4px
3. **`.logo-subtitle` font-size**: Reduced from `var(--font-size-sm)` (14px) to `var(--font-size-xs)` (12px) - saves ~2px
4. **`.logo-subtitle` margin-top**: Reduced from 4px to 2px - saves 2px

**Expected result:**
The header should now be approximately **90-100px** in height (down from 162.4px), making it much more compact and proportional to the content while maintaining the sqowe brand aesthetics and readability.

The changes are now applied. You can refresh your frontend to see the reduced header size!

👤 **USER:**
> check screenshot. text "supported formats .." should have the same align as upper string

I can see in the screenshot that the "Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png (max 10MB)" text is not center-aligned like the "Drag & drop an image here, or click to select" text above it.

Let me find and fix the alignment in the restoration component styles.

I can see the issue. The `.uploader-hint` class (line 100-104) doesn't have `text-align: center` explicitly set. Let me add it:

Perfect! I've added `text-align: center` to the `.uploader-hint` class in [restoration.css:104](frontend/src/styles/components/restoration.css#L104). 

Now the "Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png (max 10MB)" text will be center-aligned, matching the alignment of the "Drag & drop an image here, or click to select" text above it.

The change is applied and ready. Refresh your browser to see the centered alignment!

👤 **USER:**
> I have error
INFO:     172.19.0.1:38230 - "GET /api/v1/restore/history?limit=20&offset=0 HTTP/1.1" 401 Unauthorized

The 401 Unauthorized error means the authentication token is either missing, invalid, or expired when trying to access the `/api/v1/restore/history` endpoint.

Let me help you diagnose and fix this issue. First, let me check the authentication flow:

Thank you for the logs! I can see the pattern now:

1. Login succeeds: `POST /api/v1/auth/login HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
2. Models endpoint works: `GET /api/v1/models HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` 
3. **History endpoint fails: `GET /api/v1/restore/history?limit=20&offset=0 HTTP/1.1" 401 Unauthorized`**

The issue is that the `/api/v1/restore/history` endpoint is receiving a 401, even after a successful login. This suggests the JWT token might not be properly included in the request or the token validation is failing on the backend.

Let me check the backend authentication requirements for the history endpoint:

Perfect! I found the issue. Looking at line 314-319 in the restoration.py file:

```python
session_id = user.get("session_id")
if not session_id:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Invalid token: missing session information",
    )
```

The history endpoint requires a `session_id` in the JWT token payload, but the token might not include it. Let me check how the JWT token is created during login:

Good! The backend is creating the token correctly with the `session_id` (lines 106-112). The issue might be that you're using an old token that was created before this session_id feature was added to the JWT.

**Solution: You need to log out and log back in to get a fresh token with the `session_id` included.**

The issue is:
1. You logged in before and got a token **without** `session_id` 
2. That token is stored in localStorage
3. When you try to access `/api/v1/restore/history`, it sends the old token
4. The backend checks for `session_id` in the token (line 314 of restoration.py) and doesn't find it
5. Returns 401 Unauthorized

**To fix this:**

1. **Clear your browser's localStorage** or just **log out and log back in**
2. This will generate a new token with the `session_id` field
3. The history endpoint should then work correctly

You can verify this by checking your browser's developer tools:
- Open DevTools → Application (or Storage) → Local Storage
- Look for keys related to authentication
- Delete them, or just use the Logout button in the app

Would you like me to add better error handling to make this clearer, or is logging out and back in sufficient?

The issue persists even after a fresh login. Let me check the `get_current_user` function to see how it's decoding the token:

Found it! The issue is in the `get_current_user` function at **line 148**. It only returns `{"username": username}` but **doesn't include the `session_id`** from the token payload!

The token is created with both `sub` (username) and `session_id` (line 107-111 in auth.py), but `get_current_user` only extracts the username and discards the session_id.

Here's the fix:

Perfect! I've fixed the issue in [security.py:148-151](backend/app/core/security.py#L148-L151).

**The problem was:** The `get_current_user` function was only returning the username from the JWT token payload, but not the `session_id`. This caused the history endpoint to fail with 401 because it couldn't find the session_id.

**The fix:** Now `get_current_user` returns both `username` and `session_id` from the token payload.

The backend will need to restart to pick up this change. If you're running with docker-compose, the backend should auto-reload. Otherwise, restart the backend service.

After the backend restarts, try accessing the History page again - it should work now!

> check screenshot 
Reduce height of footer as well
align text "© 2025 sqowe. All rights reserved." with below text

I'll reduce the footer height and align the copyright text with the subtitle text below it. Let me check the current footer styles:

Now I'll reduce the footer padding and ensure proper text alignment:

Perfect! I've updated the footer styles in [shared.css:356-382](frontend/src/styles/components/shared.css#L356-L382):

**Changes made:**

1. **Reduced footer padding**: Changed from `var(--space-xl)` (32px) to `var(--space-md)` (16px) - saves ~32px in height
2. **Added flexbox to `.footer-content`**: Added `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, and `align-items: center` to ensure proper vertical alignment of both text elements
3. **Fixed `.footer-text` margin**: Removed the `margin-bottom` and set just `margin: 0` to eliminate extra spacing
4. **Added spacing between texts**: Added `margin-top: 2px` to `.footer-subtitle` to create consistent spacing between the copyright text and subtitle (matching the header logo spacing)

The footer should now be much more compact (approximately 50-60px in height instead of ~90px) and both text lines will be properly center-aligned. Refresh your browser to see the changes!

👤 **USER:**
> remove header and footer from login page

I'll remove the header and footer from the login page. Let me first check the login page structure:

I can see that the Layout component wraps all routes (line 29 in App.tsx), which means the header and footer appear on all pages including the login page. I need to modify the Layout component to conditionally show the header and footer only when the user is authenticated. Let me update both files:

Perfect! I've restructured the routing in [App.tsx:27-60](frontend/src/app/App.tsx#L27-L60) so that:

1. **Login page** (`/login`) - Renders **without** the Layout component, so no header or footer will appear
2. **Protected routes** (`/` and `/history`) - Wrapped with the Layout component, so header and footer appear on authenticated pages

This means:
- When users visit the login page, they'll see a clean login form without the header/footer
- Once logged in, the header and footer will appear on the main pages (Home and History)

The changes are applied! Refresh your browser and navigate to the login page - you should now see it without the header and footer.
